The RISC-V Talent Development Program, powered by Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR) in collaboration with VLSI System Design (VSD), is a strategic initiative aimed at cultivating a skilled workforce proficient in RISC-V and semiconductor technologies. This program is part of India's broader mission to establish a robust semiconductor ecosystem and reduce reliance on traditional hubs.
 Participants engage in a focused, hands-on cohort designed to impart practical knowledge in RISC-V architecture and semiconductor design. The curriculum encompasses fundamental physics, digital logic design, System-on-Chip (SoC) concepts, and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. Emphasis is placed on practical labs and capstone projects, enabling learners to build and simulate circuits, and design CMOS inverters.

# Task1
The objective of this task is to write a C program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a given integer n. The program initializes a sum variable to zero and iterates from 1 to n, adding each number to the sum. After execution, the result is displayed using the printf function. The program is compiled and executed using the GCC compiler, and then an attempt is made to compile it using a RISC-V compiler. The generated assembly code is also examined. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the process, including the commands used and their respective functions.
