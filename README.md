The RISC-V Talent Development Program, powered by Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR) in collaboration with VLSI System Design (VSD), is a strategic initiative aimed at cultivating a skilled workforce proficient in RISC-V and semiconductor technologies. This program is part of India's broader mission to establish a robust semiconductor ecosystem and reduce reliance on traditional hubs.
 Participants engage in a focused, hands-on cohort designed to impart practical knowledge in RISC-V architecture and semiconductor design. The curriculum encompasses fundamental physics, digital logic design, System-on-Chip (SoC) concepts, and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. Emphasis is placed on practical labs and capstone projects, enabling learners to build and simulate circuits, and design CMOS inverters.
